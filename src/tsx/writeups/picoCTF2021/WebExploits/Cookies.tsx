                Looking at the website, we see a simple form.
                However, judging from the title, we should look in the cookies.
                We find a cookie called "name".
                Changing it to 1 returns a new website that says "I love Chocolate Chip Cookies!".
                We probably need to keep on increasing the value until we find the flag.
                I found the flag on cookie #18.
