                    There is some interesting information hidden around this site &lt;problem URL&gt;. Can you find it?

                    Going to the linked website, we see nothing of value.
                    Viewing the source of the page, we find the first part of the flag in a comment.
                    There is also a css file and a js file attached so we look at those as well.
                    The css file includes the second part of the flag.
                    The JS file includes a hint:
                </p>
                <code className="pt-2" >
                    {"/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */"}
                </code>
                <p className="pt-2" >
                    You can block crawlers from accessing certain parts of your website by using the robots.txt file.
                    There, we find part 3 and another hint.
                </p>
                <code className="pt-2" >
                    # I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
                </code>
                <p className="pt-2" >
                    Apache servers have a .htaccess file, which may be where the next segment is since the word "Access" is capitalized.
                    We find part 4 and another hint.
                </p>
                <code className="pt-2" >
                    # I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
                </code>
                <p className="pt-2" >
                    Mac OS X has an index file called the .DS_Store file.
                    We should probably visit that.
                </p>
                <code className="pt-2" >
                    Congrats! You completed the scavenger hunt. Part 5: &lt;part5&gt;
                </code>
                <p className="pt-2" >
                    And we completed the hunt.
